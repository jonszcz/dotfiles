# README for dotfiles

This is a test workflow based on the blog post at [Smalley Creative](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/) where you sync .dotfiles for different apps and/or terminals via github. It's as much a test for using github as it is a valuable workflow for me at the moment.
